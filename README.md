# Active-Shape
Active Shape Model:
 A model is trained from a set of images annotated by
a human expert. By analysing the variations in shape and appearance over the
training set, a model is built which can mimic this variation. To interpret a new
image we must find the parameters which best match a model instance to the
image. We describe an algorithm which can do this efficiently. Having fit the
model to the image, the parameters or the model point positions can be used
to classify or make measurements, or as an input to further processing.
